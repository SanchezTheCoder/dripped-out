## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Powered by Convex's Game-Changing Features

**🔥 Real-Time Reactive Queries**
```typescript
const images = useQuery(api.images.getImages) || [];
```
Convex's reactive queries automatically update your UI when data changes, providing instant feedback during image processing.

**⚡ Background Job Scheduling**
```typescript
await ctx.scheduler.runAfter(0, internal.generate.generateImage, {
  storageId,
  originalImageId,
});
```
Process-intensive AI tasks run in the background, ensuring your app remains responsive and users never lose their work.

**💾 Secure File Storage**
```typescript
const uploadUrl = await generateUploadUrl();
// Upload directly to Convex Storage
const result = await fetch(uploadUrl, { method: "POST", body: file });
```
Files are uploaded directly to Convex's secure storage with automatic URL generation and access control.

**📊 Real-Time Status Updates**
```typescript
// Track processing status in real-time
images.some(img => img.generationStatus === 'pending' || img.generationStatus === 'processing')
```
Monitor AI generation progress with live status updates that automatically sync across all connected clients.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- A Convex account ([sign up here](https://www.convex.dev/))
- Google Gemini API key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd drip-me-out
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up Convex**
```bash
npx convex dev --once
```

4. **Configure environment variables**

Create a `.env.local` file:
```bash
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=your-convex-deployment-url
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
```

5. **Run the development server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your app!

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Upload or Capture**: Users can either upload an existing image or capture a live photo
2. **AI Processing**: Images are sent to Convex Storage, then scheduled for AI enhancement using Gemini 2.5 Flash
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Users see live status updates as their images are processed
4. **Instant Results**: Transformed images with diamond chains appear automatically once processing completes
